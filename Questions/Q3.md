## Problem 3:
Given a sentence of words, we need to reverse it with 3 variations.  

### Input:  
hello how are you  

### Output:  
uoy era woh olleh (reverse the sentence literally)  
olleh woh era uoy (reverse each word in the sentence)  
you are how hello (reverse the order of words in the sentence)
