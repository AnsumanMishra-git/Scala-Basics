## Problem 2:  

You are given a list of integers and integer k. Write an algorithm to find the number of elements in the list which are strictly less than k. Input: The first line of Input consists of two
space-separated integers - size and num K, representing the number of elements in the list (N) and the integer to be compared (K). The second line consists of N space-separated integers -
element[0], element[1].. element[N-1] representing the list of integers.  

### Input:
5 40  
10 20 30 40 50  

### Output:  
3
