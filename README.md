# Scala-Basics
This repository contains a collection of questions and their answers related to the basics of Scala that I have come across while doing my courses. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone seeking to practice their learning, after all the learning amounts to nothing if not tried and tested.  

### Introduction:
Scala is a general-purpose programming language that blends object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. "Scala" is an abbreviation of "Scalable Language," highlighting its ability to scale from small scripts to large-scale applications.  

Critical features of Scala include:   

1. Object-Oriented and Functional Programming: Scala seamlessly integrates object-oriented and functional programming concepts. It supports classes, traits, and inheritance, as well as higher-order functions, immutability, and pattern matching.  

2. Immutable Data Structures: Scala encourages using immutable data structures by default, promoting functional programming principles and enabling safer concurrent programming.  

3. Type Inference: Scala's type inference system can automatically infer types in many cases, reducing the need for explicit type annotations and making the code more concise and readable.  

4. Integration with Big Data Ecosystems: Scala is widely used in the Apache Spark ecosystem, a popular big data processing framework. Scala's expressive syntax and functional programming capabilities make it a natural fit for distributed data processing tasks.
